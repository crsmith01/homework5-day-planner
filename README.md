## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:
1. WHEN I open the planner,
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. WHEN I scroll down,
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
3. WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day,
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. WHEN I click into a timeblock,
    THEN I can enter an event.
5. WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock,
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6. WHEN I refresh the page,
    THEN the saved events persist.
```
